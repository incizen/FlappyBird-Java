## First Java Project
Hi! This is a project thats for Advance Programming Course using java as the programming language to demonstrate my skills in object oriented programming.

## Why This Project
I wanted to make something fun and since I'm a beginner I settled on the idea of making a game. There have been many different versions of the game and this version is one of them.

## How To Play 
The game immedietly starts when you run it. Just press space to move the bird and avoid colliding with the pipes. You can press space to restart the game.

## How to Run program
To run the program you can just clone the repository and run the program directly, all the libraries I used in the game are built into Java. Since I used Jframe there are no need to install any other dependencies.
